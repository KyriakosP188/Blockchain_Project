# Noobcah: A block-chain Project

Nooobcash is a a simple finance application based on block-chain technology to ensure the Consesus of the system. It is basically a cryptocurency system which constsits of as many users as we determined. Transactions that are held into the system are stored in bolcks and in order to be atached to the main cahain have to validated by the some network user. All users that form the curency network are also minres which mine their block and prevent curency reusability and malicious transtactions.

System also includes a cli with which we can acces every user of the network by its port. After you create all users in seperate therds initial trasatcions are held giving its one of them a starting aount of NBC coins. After that accessing accounts from cli gived the ability to perform transactions betwwens network nodes and oberve the block mining prosses. 

The above project is created for a univercity project but is also a complete basic form of a cryptocarency network based into block-chain technology.
